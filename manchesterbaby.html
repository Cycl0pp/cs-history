                <h3 class="display-6">Why Significant</h3>
                <p class="lead">The Manchester Baby, known formally as the Small-Scale Experimental Machine, was the first computer to store and run a program from memory. This was an integral step in developing modern computers, which perform the same task regularly.</p>
                <h3 class="display-6">History</h3>
                <p>This proof-of-concept machine was built from military surplus supplies and was meant to prove that programs could be stored and recalled electronically. It could store up to 1,024 bits, using one Williams-Kilburn tube. None of the original parts remain.
